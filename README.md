# Bertram Labs Coding Challenge

This program helps you and your coworkers decide who should pay for coffee based on the coffee orders.

## How to Run:
   > IDLE software was used to run code
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DylanPho/Bertram_Labs_Coding_Challenge_Coffee.git

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Bertram_Labs_Coding_Challenge_Coffee
   
3. **Run the Program:**
   ```bash
   python Coffee_Payer_Select.py
   
**Follow the Prompts:**
  - The type of coffee and price are given once the code is running.
  - Enter the type of coffee each person ordered when prompted (from the list).
  - After selecting the coffee payer, the program will also provide the next coffee payer for the next day.

**Assumptions**:
  - **Fixed Coffee Prices:** Prices of coffee beverages remain at a certain price.
  - **Equal Participation:** All coworkers will participate in paying and are eligible to be selected.
  - **User Input Validation:** The user will input valid coffee orders and respond appropriately to prompts, without the need for extensive error handling.
  - **Random Selection:** The selection of the coffee payer is random and unbiased, with each coworker having an equal chance of being selected.
  - **Single Payment:** Assuming that only one coworker will pay for all the coffee beverages ordered by the group, rather than splitting the payment among multiple coworkers.

# Language Software:
  - IDLE: Python 3.12.1
